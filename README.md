# Google-Analytics-4-Project-User-Retention-Cohort-Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project is a **Google Analytics 4 Cohort Analysis Report** and the aim of this project is to explore Cohorts, and examine their behavior over a prolonged period of time. In this project I have created 3 reports. First is a normal Cohort Analysis Report, for second I have added segment of Mobile vs Desktop Users to survey upon how different Users of both segments behave and how much do they retain. Third report I have added added a breakdown of gender to gain insights upon how the Users who belong to different genders behave and how much do they retain. With this project I was able to generate key insights about how User Retention works.

**Disclaimer:** This project uses demo data; no real business data is involved.

## ‚úÖ Recommended Actions
- There could be a reason of unsatisfaction during interaction with the website which made Users not willing to come again. Optimizing on website could lead to more retention. 
- Maybe because of it is more convenient to shop on Desktop rather then on Mobile. Improving the UI for mobile could help change this narrative.
- Females tend to always prefer more options and careful scrutiny over all possible options then concluding over one hence the Female Users segment saw a dip compared to Male Users segment. Completion analyzing can help channel all Females to single website by looking into what the other competitor is providing which attracts Female Audience.
